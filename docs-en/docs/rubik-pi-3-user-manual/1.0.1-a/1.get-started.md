## Preparations

* Computer running Windows 10 and later, or Ubuntu 18 – Ubuntu 22

* RUBIK Pi 3

* USB Type-A to Type-C cable

* USB Type-A to Micro USB cable

* Power supply (12V 3A Type-C)

:::danger[Warning:]

- Do not use a desktop or laptop computer to power your RUBIK Pi 3. This may cause damage to both the computer and the RUBIK Pi 3.
- Any external power supply used with the RUBIK Pi must comply with all applicable local laws and regulations.
- A **12 V DC power supply rated at ≥ 3 A** is required. The power supply should feature overcurrent, overvoltage, and surge protection.

### Download images

RUBIK Pi 3 comes with a pre-installed Linux image (not the latest version) for a quick out-of-the-box experience. If you need the latest version of the Android image or other operating system images, visit the [RUBIK Pi 3 official website](https://www.thundercomm.com/rubik-pi-3/en/docs/image/).

* Qualcomm Linux is a simplified desktop system based on Weston. It is suitable for developers who have Linux development experience and seek an in-depth development experience.

  ![](images/image-20.jpg)

* Debian 13: Based on GNOME 48, Debian 13 offers a complete set of system features, a rich software package library, more desktop applications, an enhanced user experience, and abundant development resources, making it ideal for developers who prioritize development convenience.

  ![](images/image-24.jpg)

* Android 13 is an enhanced system based on Google AOSP, offering an improved experience for developers working on Android applications.

  RUBIK Pi 3 provides two Android image versions: user and userdebug. In the Android system, user and userdebug are different build types designed for distinct use cases.

  * The user version is a production build intended for end users, focusing on security and stability. It disables debugging features, restricts root access and advanced ADB commands, and minimizes log output to ensure smooth system performance and protect user privacy, delivering a reliable experience for daily use.

  * The userdebug version is a development build designed for developers and testers. It offers enhanced debugging support, including temporary root access, full ADB functionality, and detailed logging. This makes it ideal for tasks such as modifying system files, monitoring application behavior, or troubleshooting. However, due to its elevated permissions and additional resource usage, it is less secure and is recommended only for development and testing purposes.

### Flash images

![](images/image-18.jpg)

Before flashing images, enter flash mode (9008 mode) using one of the following methods:

:::warning
>
> * Do not touch the PCB components and metal contacts with your bare hands.
>
> * Before operation, discharge static electricity using grounding equipment (e.g., anti-static workstation/wrist strap).
>
> * Do not place the circuit board directly on conductive surfaces (such as metal tables or ungrounded chassis).
:::

Method 1:

1. Press and hold the **\[EDL]** button (No. 12 in the figure above).

   ![](images/image-23.jpg)

2. Connect the power supply into port 10, as shown in the figure below.&#x20;

   ![](images/baabfa63-45f7-4d4a-8085-040718e7a161.jpg)

3) Insert the Type-C cable into port 5 and wait three seconds to enter 9008 mode.

#### Flash images on a Windows system

<a id="flashwin"></a>

1. Install the WinUSB driver. (If you have installed it, skip this step.)
 
   1. Uninstall other drivers for this device. Make sure that Qualcomm USB drivers and similar drivers are not installed. 

       * The device should not appear under the COM ports in Device Manager. If you see the device under the COM ports, follow the instructions to uninstall QUD.  

       ![](images/20250604-151545.jpg)

       * Ensure that **Delete the driver software for this device** is checked.

       ![](images/20250604-151617.jpg)

   2. Power off the device and re-enter the flashing mode. Follow the instructions below to install Microsoft WinUSB.

       * In Device Manager, right-click the USB port of RUBIK Pi 3 and select **Update driver.**

       ![](images/20250602-215747.jpg)

       * In the pop-up window, choose the **Browse my computer for driver software** option.

       ![](images/20250602-215852.jpg)

       * Under USB devices, select **WinUsb Device**.

2. In the terminal, use the following command to run the QDL executable from either the *QDL_Win_x64* or *QDL_Win_ARM64* directory based on your host architecture to flash the image. Once the flashing process is complete, the device will automatically reboot.

:::note
>
> The program file name does not support wildcards. Each image file must be listed in the command explicitly.

>
> Replace `<pathToQDL>` with the actual location of the *QDL_Win_x64* or *QDL_Win_ARM64* directory.
:::

```shell
<pathToQDL>\QDL.exe prog_firehose_ddr.elf rawprogram0.xml rawprogram1.xml rawprogram2.xml rawprogram3.xml rawprogram4.xml rawprogram5.xml patch0.xml patch1.xml patch2.xml patch3.xml patch4.xml patch5.xml

:::

:::warning
>
> After provisioning, some information stored in the UFS, such as the SN and Ethernet MAC address, may be lost.
>
> Replace `<pathToQDL>` with the actual location of the *QDL_Win_ARM64* or *QDL_Win_x64* directory.
:::

```shell
<pathToQDL>\QDL.exe prog_firehose_ddr.elf provision_ufs_1_3.xml
```
![](images/20250603-142559.jpg)

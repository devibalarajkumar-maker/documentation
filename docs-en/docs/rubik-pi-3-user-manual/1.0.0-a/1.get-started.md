### Download images

RUBIK Pi 3 comes with a pre-installed Linux image (not the latest version) for a quick out-of-the-box experience. If you need the latest version of the Android image or other operating system images, visit the [RUBIK Pi 3 official website](https://www.thundercomm.com/rubik-pi-3/en/docs/image/).

* Qualcomm Linux is a simplified desktop system based on Weston. It is suitable for developers who have Linux development experience and seek an in-depth development experience.

  ![](images/image-20.jpg)

* Debian 13: Based on GNOME 48, Debian 13 offers a complete set of system features, a rich software package library, more desktop applications, an enhanced user experience, and abundant development resources, making it ideal for developers who prioritize development convenience.

  ![](images/image-24.jpg)

* Android 13 is an enhanced system based on Google AOSP, offering an improved experience for developers working on Android applications.

  RUBIK Pi 3 provides two Android image versions: user and userdebug. In the Android system, user and userdebug are different build types designed for distinct use cases.

  * The user version is a production build intended for end users, focusing on security and stability. It disables debugging features, restricts root access and advanced ADB commands, and minimizes log output to ensure smooth system performance and protect user privacy, delivering a reliable experience for daily use.

  * The userdebug version is a development build designed for developers and testers. It offers enhanced debugging support, including temporary root access, full ADB functionality, and detailed logging. This makes it ideal for tasks such as modifying system files, monitoring application behavior, or troubleshooting. However, due to its elevated permissions and additional resource usage, it is less secure and is recommended only for development and testing purposes.

   ![](images/image-14.jpg)

   * Reset After Download: When this option is selected, the device will reboot automatically after image flashing is completed.

   * Erase All Before Download: When this option is selected, the data in each RUBIK Pi 3 UFS partition will be erased before flashing.

     :::note
     >
     > * The **Erase All Before Download** option takes effect only when the UFS partitions are the same before and after flashing.
     >
     > * Selecting **Reset After Download** or **Erase All Before Download** is not a mandatory action. You are not required to select one of them.
     :::

### Flash images

![](images/image-14.jpg)



Before flashing images, enter flash mode (9008 mode) using one of the following methods:

:::warning
>
> * Do not touch the PCB components and metal contacts with your bare hands.
>
> * Before operation, discharge static electricity using grounding equipment (e.g., anti-static workstation/wrist strap).
>
> * Do not place the circuit board directly on conductive surfaces (such as metal tables or ungrounded chassis).
:::

Method 1:

1. Press and hold the **\[EDL]** button (No. 12 in the figure above).

   ![](images/image-17.jpg)

2. Connect the power supply into port 10, as shown in the figure below.&#x20;

   ![](images/image-16.jpg)

3) Insert the Type-C cable into port 5 and wait three seconds to enter 9008 mode.

   ![](images/20250314-155547-1.jpg)

Method 2:

1. Connect the power supply into port 10.

   ![](images/20250314-155550.jpg)

2. Insert the Type-C cable into port 5.

   ![](images/20250314-155547.jpg)

3) After RUBIK Pi 3 boots up, run the following command to enter 9008 mode.

   ```shell
   adb shell reboot edl
   ```

#### Flash images on a Windows system

##### Operation procedure

1. Open the Tflash software. Make sure the device is in 9008 mode, as shown in the following figure:

   ![](images/image-25.jpg)

2. Select the **Storage Type** of the device to be flashed. For RUBIK Pi 3, select **UFS** for **Storage Type**.

   ![](images/image-22.jpg)

3) Select **Reset After Download** or **Erase All Before Download** as needed. Exercise caution when selecting **Erase All Before Download**.

   ![](images/image-23.jpg)

   * Reset After Download: When this option is selected, the device will reboot automatically after image flashing is completed.

   * Erase All Before Download: When this option is selected, the data in each RUBIK Pi 3 UFS partition will be erased before flashing.

     :::note
     >
     > * Selecting **Reset After Download** or **Erase All Before Download** is not a mandatory action. You are not required to select one of them.
     >
     > * The **Erase All Before Download** option takes effect only when the UFS partitions are the same before and after flashing.
     >
     > * When flashing images of different operating systems (for example, switching from Android to Debian), it is recommended to select the **Erase All Before Download** option.
     :::

### 1.11.2 Install cross-compilation tools<a id="section-1.11.2"></a>

1. On the Ubuntu host, visit the RUBIK Pi official website to download the [cross-compilation toolchain](https://thundercomm.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/web/rubik-pi-3/20250325/toolchains_V1.1.0.zip) for RUBIK Pi 3, then run the following command to decompress it.

    ```shell showLineNumbers
   unzip toolchains_V1.1.0.zip
   ```

    :::note
    The cross-compilation tool is an eSDK built using the Yocto Project. The eSDK is a software package generated from the Qualcomm Linux image. It is installed on an Ubuntu host and provides a Yocto-based environment for application development.

    For details about eSDK compilation, refer to the [Yocto Project User Guide](/rubik-pi-3/en/docs/rubik-pi-3-user-manual/1.1.0/yocto) section.
    :::

* Run the following commands in the Ubuntu terminal to install the cross-compilation toolchain.

   ```shell showLineNumbers
  cd toolchains
  chmod 755 qcom-wayland-x86_64-qcom-multimedia-image-armv8-2a-qcm6490-idp-toolchain-ext-1.3-ver.1.1.sh
  sh qcom-wayland-x86_64-qcom-multimedia-image-armv8-2a-qcm6490-idp-toolchain-ext-1.3-ver.1.1.sh
  ```

3. Follow the prompts to install the cross-compilation environment, type the absolute path to the installation directory, and type "Y".

4. After the installation is completed, go to the installation directory and run the following command to set up the cross-compilation environment.

    ```shell showLineNumbers
   source environment-setup-armv8-2a-qcom-linux
   ```

    :::note
   The cross-compilation environment is only effective on the current terminal.
    :::

   If the following error occurs, type the `unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH` command and run the above command again.

   ![](images/image-74.jpg)

5. Run the following command in the Ubuntu terminal to check the version of the gcc toolchain. If the output is as follows, it indicates that the cross-compilation environment is set up successfully.

    ```shell showLineNumbers
   aarch64-qcom-linux-gcc -v 
   ```

   ![](images/image-72.jpg)

### 1.11.3 Use the cross-compilation tools<a id="section-1.11.3"></a>

After setting up the cross-compilation environment by using the `source environment-setup-armv8-2a-qcom-linux` command as described in the previous section, use the following method to cross-compile the executable program of RUBIK Pi 3.

#### 1.11.3.1 Use the Makefile build

The header file path *sysroot* must be set for cross-compilation. Use the `--sysroot=dir` parameter to specify the path.

 ```shell showLineNumbers
aarch64-qcom-linux-gcc --sysroot=/home/zhy/rubikpi/sdk/sysroots/armv8-2a-qcom-linux
```

:::note
In the above command, the cross-compilation toolchain is installed at the */home/zhy/rubikpi/sdk* directory of the PC. Change the directory to your actual installation directory.
:::

#### 1.11.3.2 Build the project using CMake

The following is an example using *aarch64.cmake*:

 ```cmake showLineNumbers
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR arm64) #Set the target processor architecture

#Set sysroot
set(TOOLCHAIN_DIR /home/zhy/rubikpi/sdk/sysroots/armv8-2a-qcom-linux)
set(CMAKE_SYSROOT ${TOOLCHAIN_DIR}/sysroots/armv8-2a-qcom-linux)

#Set the cross-compiler
SET(CMAKE_C_COMPILER ${TOOLCHAIN_DIR}/sysroots/x86_64-qcomsdk-linux/usr/bin/aarch64-qcom-linux/aarch64-qcom-linux-gcc)
SET(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER ${TOOLCHAIN_DIR}/sysroots/x86_64-qcomsdk-linux/usr/bin/aarch64-qcom-linux/aarch64-qcom-linux-g++)

set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
```

When using CMake to build a project, create a *CMakeLists.txt* according to the actual situation of the project and run the following command to generate the Makefile.

 ```shell showLineNumbers
$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=aarch64.cmake
```

## 1.12 Linux kernel

It is advisable to conduct Linux kernel development in an environment running Ubuntu 18 – Ubuntu 22.

<a id="section-1.12.1"></a>
### 1.12.1 Download code

 ```shell showLineNumbers
git clone https://github.com/rubikpi-ai/linux.git
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### 1.12.2 Compile code<a id="section-1.12.2"></a>

1. Set up the cross-compilation environment. For details, refer to [1.11.2. Install cross-compilation tools](/rubik-pi-3/en/docs/rubik-pi-3-user-manual/1.1.0/quick-start#1112-install-cross-compilation-tools).

    ```shell showLineNumbers
   source <your toolchains directory>/environment-setup-armv8-2a-qcom-linux
   ```

    :::note
    The cross-compilation environment is only effective on the current terminal.
    :::

   If the following error occurs, input the `unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH` command and run the above command again.

   ![](images/image-70.jpg)

2. Go to the kernel directory and compile the kernel.

    ```shell showLineNumbers
   ./rubikpi_build.sh -a
   ```

    :::note
    * The first compilation takes a longer time based on different computer configurations. In most cases, it takes less than 20 minutes. Subsequent compilations are only performed on modified code.
   * The kernel directory can be cleaned up using the `make clean` command, after which all compilation artifacts and some configuration content will be deleted.
   :::

3. Go to the kernel directory. Package the kernel and device tree image.

    ```shell showLineNumbers
   ./rubikpi_build.sh -dp -ip  # Package image
   ```

   ![](images/image-66.jpg)

   If the following error occurs when you package the image:

   ![](images/image-65.jpg)

   Run the following command to modify the *.mtoolsrc* file, add `mtools_skip_check=1`, and try packaging the image again.

    ```shell showLineNumbers
   vim ~/.mtoolsrc
   ```

    :::note
   In the update of March 2025, if non-official images of RUBIK Pi 3 are flashed, copy *efi.bin&#x20;*&#x69;n the corresponding image package to the *rubikpi/tools/pack&#x20;*&#x64;irectory before packaging.
   :::

4. Go to the kernel directory and flash the kernel and device tree image.

    ```shell showLineNumbers
   ./rubikpi_flash.sh -d -i -r  # Flash
   ```

    :::note
    Before flashing, ensure that RUBIK Pi 3 has entered fastboot mode. Use one of the following methods to enter fastboot mode:
    * In the RUBIK Pi 3 terminal, input `reboot bootloader`. When RUBIK Pi 3 enters fastboot mode, the blue indicator lights up.
    * Press and hold the **[PWR]** button until the blue indicator lights up.
    
    For details about how to use the `./rubikpi_build.sh` and `./rubikpi_flash.sh` scripts, use the `–h` parameter.
    :::

### 1.12.3 Compile the ko driver module separately

1. Create a Makefile as follows. Change KDIR to the actual kernel source code directory.

   ```makefile
   obj-m += hello.o  
   KDIR:=/home/rubikpi/kernel-6.6
   PWD?=$(shell pwd)
   all:
           make -C $(KDIR) M=$(PWD) modules
           echo $(PWD)
   clean:
           rm -f *.ko *.o *.mod *.mod.o *.mod.c *.symvers *.order
   ```

2. Create a *hello.c* file as follows:

    ```c showLineNumbers
   #include <linux/module.h>
   #include <linux/init.h>

   static int hello_init(void)
   {
       printk("hello RUBIK Pi!\n");
       return 0;
   }

   static void hello_exit(void)
   {
       printk("bye RUBIK Pi!\n");
   }

   module_init(hello_init);
   module_exit(hello_exit);

   MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
   MODULE_VERSION("V1.0");
   MODULE_AUTHOR("RUBIK Pi");
   ```

3. Run the following commands to compile the ko module:

    ```bash showLineNumbers
   export ARCH=arm64  
   export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-qcom-linux-  
   make
   ```

4. Transfer hello.ko to your RUBIK Pi 3 using the ADB or SCP method.

5. Run the following commands on your RUBIK Pi 3 to verify that the compilation artifact is valid.

    ```shell showLineNumbers
   insmod hello.ko
   rmmod hello.ko
   dmesg | grep "RUBIK Pi"
   ```

### 1.12.4 Configure the kernel

Run the following commands to configure the Linux kernel using menuconfig:

 ```bash showLineNumbers
cd linux  
make ARCH=arm64 menuconfig
```

After the configuration is completed, run the following commands to save the configuration.

 ```shell showLineNumbers
make ARCH=arm64 savedefconfig  
cp defconfig ./arch/arm64/configs/rubik_pi3_defconfig
```

### 1.12.5 Directory analysis

After the `git clone` operation in [1.12.1. Download code](/rubik-pi-3/en/docs/rubik-pi-3-user-manual/1.1.0/quick-start#1121-download-code), the RUBIK Pi 3 Linux repository is as shown in the following figure:
